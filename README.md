🚀 System Design Fundamentals – Daily Learning Series

Welcome to my System Design Mastery Repository.

This repository is a structured collection of core system design concepts that every Backend Engineer, Full Stack Developer, and Software Architect must understand to build scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems.

I will be posting and expanding one concept daily with:

✅ Clear explanations

✅ Real-world examples

✅ Architecture diagrams

✅ Trade-offs

✅ Interview insights

📚 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Client–Server Architecture

Understanding how clients communicate with servers using request-response models.

2️⃣ IP Address

How devices identify and communicate over networks (IPv4 vs IPv6).

3️⃣ DNS (Domain Name System)

How domain names resolve to IP addresses.

4️⃣ Proxy & Reverse Proxy

Traffic forwarding, security, caching, and load distribution.

5️⃣ Latency

Understanding network delay and performance optimization.

6️⃣ HTTP / HTTPS

Stateless communication protocol of the web and secure encryption (TLS/SSL).

7️⃣ APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

How systems communicate with each other.

8️⃣ REST API

Resource-based architecture using HTTP methods.

9️⃣ GraphQL

Query-based API architecture for flexible data fetching.

🔟 Databases

Persistent data storage systems.

1️⃣1️⃣ SQL vs NoSQL

Relational vs Non-relational databases and trade-offs.

1️⃣2️⃣ Vertical Scaling

Scaling by increasing machine capacity (CPU, RAM).

1️⃣3️⃣ Horizontal Scaling

Scaling by adding more machines.

1️⃣4️⃣ Load Balancers

Distributing traffic across multiple servers.

1️⃣5️⃣ Database Indexing

Improving query performance using indexes.

1️⃣6️⃣ Replication

Copying data across multiple database nodes.

1️⃣7️⃣ Sharding

Splitting large databases across multiple machines.

1️⃣8️⃣ Vertical Partitioning

Splitting tables by columns for optimization.

1️⃣9️⃣ Caching

Reducing database load using temporary storage (Redis, Memcached).

2️⃣0️⃣ Denormalization

Improving read performance by reducing joins.

2️⃣1️⃣ CAP Theorem

Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance trade-offs.

2️⃣2️⃣ Blob Storage

Storing unstructured large objects (images, videos, files).

2️⃣3️⃣ CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Reducing latency using geographically distributed servers.

2️⃣4️⃣ WebSockets

Real-time bidirectional communication.

2️⃣5️⃣ Webhooks

Event-driven HTTP callbacks.

2️⃣6️⃣ Microservices Architecture

Breaking applications into independent services.

2️⃣7️⃣ Message Queues

Asynchronous communication (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

2️⃣8️⃣ Rate Limiting

Controlling request traffic to prevent abuse.

2️⃣9️⃣ API Gateway

Single entry point for microservices.

3️⃣0️⃣ Idempotency

Ensuring repeated requests produce the same result.
